This is good, and saves some work, but pay attention to this block:
```speak(unsigned long):
  push rbp
  push rbx
  sub rsp, 8
  test rdi, rdi
  je .L64
  mov edx, 3
  mov esi, OFFSET FLAT:.LC1
  cmp rdi, 1
  je .L63
  mov edx, 3
  mov esi, OFFSET FLAT:.LC2
  cmp rdi, 2
  je .L63
  mov edx, 3
  mov esi, OFFSET FLAT:.LC3
  cmp rdi, 3
  je .L63
  mov edx, 3
  mov esi, OFFSET FLAT:.LC4
  cmp rdi, 4
  je .L63
  cmp rdi, 5
  jne .L21
  mov edx, 3
  mov esi, OFFSET FLAT:.LC5
```
See all of those je/jne instructions? Those are branches.
Branches are bad because the processor is going to try to predict which way the branch goes, and if it mispredicts, you fucked up.
Branch misprediction is a big performance parameter. You want to avoid lots of branching sequences if possible.
Option 3: The chad unrolled looping switch approach https://godbolt.org/z/9B_BM4

Look at this bad boy right here
```speak(unsigned long):
  push rbp
  push rbx
  sub rsp, 8
  cmp rdi, 5
  ja .L67
  mov edx, 3
  jmp [QWORD PTR .L7[0+rdi*8]]
.L7:
  .quad .L5
  .quad .L11
  .quad .L10
  .quad .L9
  .quad .L8
  .quad .L6
```
It creates a lookup table of what option to go to
So there's one branch (granted, with multiple options) at that jmp instruction, but this is significantly better than chains of branch after branch after branch
So this is why it's important to look at the disassembly of your code and see what the compiler is doing.
(And I should benchmark this too just to be sure.)
